# NotReally_Pacman_AI_DS_Project
Pacman style game in pygame, final project for University

This is the Manual Game project for AI class, it is a Pacman Style game where it is used to study how an AI techniques behaves in this environment

or really this is just a pathfinding algorithm with more personality i guess if you think about it

How to run the program?, main.py

when you installed the zip of this file, make sure that you run the folder of the PACKMAN - V.2(GASTARADV) for example in folder
like this i meant

because initially the folder when you installed the zip is the name of this project folder(NotReally_Pacman_AI_DS_Project-main), and if you run the code in this project folder it will caused an error of the path for the assets

what differs is that each difficulty have the ghosts enemy, as said briefly

Easy = Blinky
